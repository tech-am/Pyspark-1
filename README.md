# Pyspark
This basic introduction is to compare common data wrangling methods in Pyspark and pandas data frame with a concrete example. Here, I used US countiesâ€™ COVID-19 dataset to show the data wrangling differences between these two types of data frames. The dataset can be downloaded from a Kaggle Dataset This should allow you to get started with data manipulation and analysis under both pandas and spark. Specific objectives are to show you how to:
1. Load data from local files
2. Display the schema of the DataFrame
3. Change data types of the DataFrame
4. Show the head of the DataFrame
5. Select columns from the DataFrame
6. Show the statistics of the DataFrame
7. Drop duplicates
8. Missing Values (check NA, drop NA, replace NA)
9. Datetime manipulations
10. Filter data based on conditions
11. Aggregation functions
12. Sort Data
13. Rename columns
14. Create new columns
15. Join tables
16. User Defined functions
17. Window function
18. Operate SQL queries within DataFrame
19. Convert one type of DataFrame to another
20. Export the data
